    <h1>OnTheBall: Analytics Visualization Tool for the Basketball Analyst</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p>Data-Driven analysis for the game of Basketball has surged in popularity in recent years. While large amounts of data are collected
            about the game, effective analysis and visualization tools are still
            in their infancy. To aid in the analysis of the large amounts of data
            collected, we have created a visualization tool to perform domainspecific tasks in the field of Basketball analytics. Our approach
            towards tackling this issue provides a robust tool for visualization of
            data for use by Basketball analysts, coaches, and general managers.</p>
        <p>Domain problems that need to be tackled are the ability to directly compare the visualized statistics of individual players and 
            teams to discover where some excel and where some falter. These insights provide novel approaches and strategies to the game of 
            Basketball. Another specific domain problem is needing to identify what specific statistics are conducive to winning the game. 
            while the game is decided by the number of points scored by each team, certain statistics may be heavily correlated with 
            favorable game outcomes. </p>
        <p>The NBA has recently surpassed 10-billion-dollars in revenue, marking a significant growth in interest for the sport of basketball. Due to
            the immense financial incentives, NBA teams are constantly looking
            for ways to improve their play and get an edge over their competitors.</p>
        <p>This tool will compile data regarding various team statistics (such as
            field goal percentage, opponent field goal percentage, shot selection
            distributions, rebound differential, etc.) and demonstrate how they
            contribute to winning. Specifically, the tool will allow users to
            analyze the interactions between multiple attributes, and see the
            statistical profiles of the most winning (and least winning) teams</p>
        <p>This tool will be usable by NBA coaches and general managers
            to determine areas of improvement for their teams, as specific teams’
            statistics will be available upon a query for comparison purposes.
            For example, a coach can see how their team’s opponent’s FG and
            rebound rate compare to winning teams, as well as which is more
            important to improve if they want a better record next year. This can
            inform roster moves, coaching emphases, and playbook changes,
            among other possible actions. Furthermore, if a team’s win rate
            does not match the typical win rates of teams with similar statistics,
            it suggests there is another, more pressing change that needs to be
            emphasized. </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <div>
            <H3>Data</H3>
            <p>The data being used for the visualization is from a Kaggle dataset
                by Nathan Lauga, who scraped the data from the official NBA
                website. This data is collected on a per-game basis by professional
                scorekeepers and uploaded to the website postgame. The dataset
                contains data on every individual game, including each player’s
                statistical contributions as well as important team statistics. From
                this, we have derived averages of each player’s per-game statistics
                (such as points per game, assists per game, turnovers per game) and
                compiled statistical totals (games played, minutes played, total field
                goals made).</p>
            <p>There exists little inherent bias as presented in the raw dataset.
                As basic statistics are collected in their totality with no missing
                values, there is little room for inherent bias; furthermore, there are
                no ethical considerations to the sourcing of data. However, one must
                consider the various imperfections and tradeoffs associated with
                more advanced metrics. For example, player efficiency rating (PER)
                disproportionately values shotmaking over every other metric, which
                overvalues catch-and-shoot players while undervaluing shot creation
                and non-scoring related aspects of the game. These advanced metrics
                will be presented to users, however, as they are commonly used;
                explanations of these stats will be available to explain potential
                limitations and biases.</p>
